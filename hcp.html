        <p>Role: Education and Onboarding Team Lead</p>
        <p>GitHub: https://github.com/Husky-Coding-Project</p>
        <p>The Husky Coding Project is a University of Washington RSO created to provide students with experiences that simulate internships. We accomplish this goal by facilitating the creation of student-led group projects where students can create meaningful, and larger-scale applications that they can show-off while job-hunting. As a club leader, I have mentored multiple of these groups and focused on project idea brainstorming, project specification creation, and code developement. In addition to mentoring, I have worked as an HCP education team lead and onboarding team lead. Through these roles I have thoroughly documented HCP's onboarding processes and created and presented 5 workshops covering a wide range of technical topics.</p>
